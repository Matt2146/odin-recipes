        <p>Using cheese curds or any type of cheese at your choice, you can make these tasty cheese bites anywhere on the go!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>10 oz mozzarella string cheese (or 10 sticks)</li>
            <li>1 cup Italian bread crumbs </li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Take out a cutting board and cut your string cheese sticks into bite sized pieces. This should get you four or five bites per stick.            </li>
            <li>In a medium sized bowl, add your eggs and whisk to break them up. Add the milk and whisk again to incorporate the two ingredients.      </li>
            <li>Set aside two additional bowls. Fill one with your flour and the next with your bread crumbs. Place the bowl with your eggs and milk mixture in the middle of that line, so that you now have three bowls in a row (flour, eggs, bread crumbs).</li>
            <li>*If you want to add a little spice to your cheese balls, put a few shakes of cayenne pepper into the bread crumbs and mix it well with a small spoon to incorporate. </li>
            <li>Take one piece of mozzarella. Dip it in the flour, then immediately dredge it in the egg mixture. Now, roll your cheese bite around in the bread crumbs. Continue to do this until you have all the pieces of cheese breaded. You can place each finished piece on a plate once they are completed.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized skillet, heat your vegetable oil (about 2 inches high) to 350 degrees. If you aren’t sure what temperature your oil is at, you can use a candy thermometer or stick the end of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles collect around the handle and start moving around, your oil is ready.</li>
            <li>Pull out a plate and line it with a paper towel. You may want a second lined plate as well if you are making the entire package of mozzarella sticks at once.            </li>
            <li>Add 5-7 pieces into the oil for about 30 seconds. Make sure that you keep them separated so that they don’t bond together! We love the gooeyness, but we’re looking for individual pieces here.         </li>
            <li>Fry your mozzarella bites until they are golden brown (which should be at that 30 second mark). Using a slotted spoon, remove your pieces from the oil and place them on the paper towels. </li>
            <li>Repeat this process with different batches until all of your bites are fried.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately to preserve the soft meltiness of each bite!</li>
        </ol>
